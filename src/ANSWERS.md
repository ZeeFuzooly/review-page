# Instructions for Senior UI/UX Engineer Technical Assessment

## Question 1

Write a small description about your favorite piece of UI/UX design (maybe even provide a link to it for us to check out!)

One of my favorite UI/UX designs is a food delivery app I worked on, which expertly balances user-friendly functionality with emotional engagement.

Key Design Elements:

Intuitive Navigation: The app features a bottom navigation bar with clear icons, allowing users to easily search for items, filter results, and track their orders. Essential functions are prioritized to streamline the ordering process.

Emotional Design: A dark theme with vibrant, contrasting colors creates a visually engaging experience. High-quality images of food items are used to entice users and make the ordering process more appealing.

Color and Typography: The app uses a calming green color palette paired with the Poppins typeface for readability and consistency. The design ensures a seamless user experience with clear text and balanced visual elements.

Gamification: Incorporates interactive features such as QR code scanning and loyalty rewards to enhance user engagement and retention.

## Question 2

As a UI/UX designer, how would you respond to negative feedback about your designs?

As a UI/UX designer, I believe that feedback whether positive or negative is crucial for growth and improvement. Here’s how I approach it:

Stay Open-Minded: I approach all feedback with an open mind. It's important to recognize that feedback, regardless of whether it's positive or negative, provides valuable insights and perspectives that can lead to improvement.

Seek Clarity: For negative feedback, I ask for specific examples or details to understand the exact issues being raised. This helps me pinpoint areas that need attention and ensures that I address concerns effectively.

Analyze and Reflect: I carefully analyze feedback to see how it aligns with user needs and project goals. Reflecting on feedback helps me determine its validity and how it can enhance the overall design.

Iterate and Improve: I use feedback as a guide for making necessary adjustments and improvements. Prioritizing changes based on feedback can significantly enhance the user experience and ensure the design meets expectations.

Communicate and Collaborate: Keeping communication open with stakeholders or users is essential. Discussing feedback and potential solutions collaboratively often leads to more effective design outcomes.

Learn and Adapt: Every piece of feedback is an opportunity to learn and refine my skills. Embracing both positive and negative feedback helps me grow as a designer and continuously improve the quality of my work.

In any role—whether as a designer, engineer, or in any other field—being open to feedback, both positive and negative, is key to personal and professional development.



## Question 3

What do you think of the review page you just designed? Is it something you like, or is there anything you would change?


Working on the review page assignment was both fun and educational. I particularly enjoyed experimenting with animations and integrating interactive elements like the rating wheel and feedback meter. It was a great opportunity to apply and enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I learned a lot about creating dynamic, user-friendly interfaces.

Reflecting on the design, while I’m pleased with how it turned out, there are a few areas I’d consider refining. For instance, tweaking some of the animation effects or adjusting the interactive elements based on user feedback could further improve the user experience. Overall, the assignment was a valuable learning experience, and I’m excited about the insights gained and how they can be applied to future projects.
